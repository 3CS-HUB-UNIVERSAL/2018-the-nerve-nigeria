The Kenyan Government has reinstated its commitment to promoting electricity generation from renewable energy sources as the country targets a 100 percent transition to green energy by 2020. According to Kenya’s President, Uhuru Kenyatta, “Our target is to attain 100 per cent green energy sufficiency by 2020. We will do this while we achieve 100 per cent access to power for our population, and sharply lower costs to industry to aid our manufacturing push.” Expressing optimism in Kenya’s comprehensive green energy programme, Kenyatta solicited for support from the Green Climate Fund to help enhance the country’s green energy capabilities and accelerate the adaptation and mitigation of the impact of climate change. In the past 5 years, East Africa has emerged as a global leader in the implementation of renewable energy projects on the African continent and Kenya’s renewable energy sector is among the most active in Africa. Currently, renewable energy makes up 70 percent of installed electric power capacity in Kenya. Kenya is Africa’s first geothermal power producer and leads Africa in the number of solar power systems installed per capita. Presently, the East African country is the largest producer of geothermal power in Africa at 200 Mega Watt, with only one other African country (Ethiopia) producing geothermal power. Kenya’s president emphasized that the country is open for business in the area of green technologies manufacturing and will work hard to enable investors in this field to thrive. Kenya is also co-hosting the first ever Global Conference on Sustainable Blue Economy with Japan and Canada. The event will take place in Kenya’s capital, Nairobi between  26 and 28 November 2018.
