It’s three weeks until the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) Athletics Awards 2018, which will honour full-fledged stars, but before then the IAAF has just released the list of finalists for the Male and Female Rising Star Awards, which recognize this year’s best under-20 talent. Three Africans: Celliphine Chespol, Meseret Belete and Meskerem Mamo, made the cut for the Female Rising Star Award. Kenya’s Chespol, 19, became African senior cross-country champion and also took silver in the 3000 metres steeplechase at the Commonwealth Games in the Gold Coast and African Championships. Her season’s best time of 9:01.82 earned her the IAAF world under-20 title and was the fastest recorded in that age group all year. With two other contenders, Ethiopia is among top countries leading the nominee list: Meskerem Mamo, 19, took 5,000 metres bronze in the African Championships and set a world under-20 season’s best times over 3,000 metres and 5,000 metres with 8:33.63 and 15:05.21 respectively, while Meseret Belete, also 19, set a world under-20 half marathon best with 67min 51sec. She finished sixth and contributed to team gold at the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Valencia and won the Gothenburg half marathon. For the Male Rising Star Awards, Ethiopia’s Selemon Barega who specializes in the 5000 metres long-distance running also made the cut. The Ethiopian won the IAAF Diamond League in Brussels with a world under-20 record of 12:43.02. This remains the world’s quickest time in the event since 2005. The 20-year-old won the 2018 Ostrava Golden Spike in Czech Republic. This year alone, he has taken part in 11 international competitions, finishing in top place in six of them. Kenyan 10,000 metres long-distance runner, Rhonex Kipruto  has also had a wonderful season this year. The 19-year-old is the current 10,000 metres world under-20 champion with a time of 27:21:08.
