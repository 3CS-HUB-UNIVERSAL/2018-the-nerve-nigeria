The South African National Treasury says the decision of S&P Global Ratings to keep South Africa’s foreign-currency and local-currency credit ratings at below investment grade affords the country an opportunity to demonstrate that it can successfully implement measures to ignite growth. “These measures include the reprioritisation of public spending, the creation of the infrastructure fund as well as partnerships for growth,” Treasury said. S&P had on Friday affirmed South Africa’s long-term foreign and local currency debt ratings at ‘BB’ and ‘BB+’ respectively, and maintain a stable outlook. “Anaemic economic growth in 2018 and sizable contingent liabilities continue to weigh on South Africa’s fiscal prospects and debt burden,” S&P said. S&P now expects South Africa’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth to average 0.8 percent in 2018 and 1.8 percent in 2019. These forecasts are slightly higher than the country’s 2018 MTBPS [Medium Term Budget Policy Statement] assumptions. Treasury said the stable outlook reflects S&P’s view that “the South African government will pursue a range of economic, social and fiscal reforms, albeit over an extended period of time”, adding that it remains determined to achieve improved ratings in the period ahead. S&P has highlighted a number of risks, including subdued economic growth, which could lead to the rating being lowered. “Government is mindful of these and fully aware that the next several months are critical,” Treasury said.
