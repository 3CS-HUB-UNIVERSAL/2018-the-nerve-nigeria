Malawi has launched a state of the art Leather Design Studio and a Garments and Textiles Incubation Center worth $465,000. This will help grow the leather and textile industry in the country, influence productivity and marketability of African products at the global level as well as promote Malawi’s President Peter Mutharika’s Buy Malawi campaign. The projects were funded by the European Union under the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa’s (COMESA) Regional Integration Support Mechanism (RISM). COMESA is a free trade area with 21 member states and the support mechanism aims at assisting countries from East Africa, Southern Africa and the Indian Ocean (ESA-IO), to achieve economic liberalization. The launching ceremony was led by Malawian Minister of Industry, Trade and Tourism, Henry Mussa, Assistant Secretary General of COMESA, Kipyego Cheluget and EU representative Jose-Maria Medina Navarro. Cheluget described the facilities as a game changer that would spearhead a revolution in the Leather and garment sectors in Malawi and the region at large. Meanwhile, Mussa who noted that the facilities have the potential to grow exponentially stated that “Now Malawians do not have an excuse for not supporting the Buy Malawi campaign spearheaded by the President, because you have what it takes to produce quality in large quantities.” Jose-Maria Medina Navarro also proposed to mobilise additional grant for blending instruments of about €4.1 Billion and private sector investments in Africa to €44 Billion by 2020.
