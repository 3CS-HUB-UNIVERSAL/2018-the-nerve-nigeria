The Rwandan Unit of MTN has launched a mobile application known as MyMTN self-care App. This launch makes the company the first Rwandan telco to launch a mobile application. “It is a step forward toward our goal of making easy our customer service. Most of the transactions that had been previously done via USSD codes will be done directly with the app and our customers will no longer need to memorize multiple shortcodes that are currently being used in different transactions,” said Desire Rudahunga, MTN’s Senior Manager for Operations. This application is an all-in-one self-care tool which enables MTN customers to self-serve and engage with customer service online. MTN which seeks to increase its dominance in the Rwandan market is scouting for a $60 million syndicate loan to upgrade its network in Rwanda. The Telco hopes to seal the deal before the end of November this year in order to facilitate its competition in the telecom industry. This is not the first time MTN is raising such a huge sum from local lenders. In 2009, it secured a syndicated loan of Rwf10 billion ($11.3 million) from seven local lenders to upgrade its network. The lenders include I&M Bank (former Commercial Bank of Rwanda), Kenya Commercial Bank, Ecobank Rwanda, Cogebanque, FINA Bank, Access Bank and the Development Bank of Rwanda (BRD). If this fundraising becomes successful, it will be the biggest syndicated loan gotten from local lenders. As of 30 June 2016, MTN recorded 232.6 million subscribers across its operations and Rwanda also ranked better in 2019 Ease of Doing Business World Bank report which should give MTN Group more hope to invest in the country.
