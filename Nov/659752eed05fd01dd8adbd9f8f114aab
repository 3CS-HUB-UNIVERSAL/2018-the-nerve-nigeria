Оn 10 October 2018, Ukraine and Tunisia held political consultations to discuss the current state and prospects of Ukrainian – Tunisian cooperation in political, trade, economic, investment, educational and consular spheres. That discussion has led to the first ever poultry imports from Ukraine. The Ukrainian service for food protection noted on Thursday 29 November, that is the first time the country is exporting poultry to Tunisia, signaling that the meeting of the two countries’ Directors of the territorial departments of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs which took place in Tunisia opened more doors for trade. In the first nine months of 2018, Ukraine increased its meat exports by 21 percent to $479 million, mainly due to higher poultry sales. During the period, Ukraine’s poultry exports totaled $381 million compared to $295 million in the whole of 2017. Agriculture plays a leading role in Tunisia’s economy and poultry is a very important sector. Agriculture contributes about 12 percent to the country’s GDP and the sector is growing at around 5 percent per year. However, in 2017, Tunisia’s trade balance of food products registered a deficit of TND 728.5 million ($295 million) in H1, nearly double the amount registered in the same period the previous year. This H1 deficit amounted to 9.7 percent of the country’s overall trade deficit in the first six months of 2017. Data from Tunisia’s Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Fisheries revealed. Poultry production in Tunisia  has gone through great changes in the last forty years. The economic boom in this industry encouraged the government to give technical support in poultry breeding, especially, the importation of genetically superior breeds since middle of 1980s. Poultry ensures 59 percent of total meat production in Tunisia, contributes about 12 percent of the agricultural products and 33 percent of livestock production in the country. During 2016, broiler production reached 127 thousand tons. The egg industry on the other hand has covered all consumer demand since 1984, without any importation. In the last five years, egg production varied between 1.44 and 1.55 billion units. In 2016, turkey production amounted to 67 thousand tons.
