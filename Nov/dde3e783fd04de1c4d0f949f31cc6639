In a bid to increase electricity capacity above 2,352 megawatts, Kenya is set to commission the largest solar project in East Africa on 20 November 2018. The plant consists of 210,000 solar photovoltaic panels set on an 85-hectare land. The 54.6 MW solar plant located in Garissa County in the North Eastern region of Kenya is considered the largest in East and Central Africa and would be commisioned by Kenya’s President, Uhuru Kenyatta. Kenyan government noted that the power plant which was funded by the People’s Republic of China at a cost of Ksh13 billion is expected to feed into the national grid at one of the most competitive rates in comparison to other sources currently feeding into the grid. The plant became a reality thanks to a consortium of three Chinese engineering companies who undertook civil, mechanical and electrical works. Currently, Kenya has a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) and the company owns and operates almost all of the electricity transmission and distribution in Kenya. All the generated power of the solar plant will be sold to KPLC through a PPA signed under the Feed-in-Tariff policy. The 54.6 MW solar plant in Garissa County is expected to enhance economic development, boosting business and other economic activities, including tourism. Kenya’s renewable energy sector is among the most active in Africa. Currently, renewable energy makes up 70 percent of installed electric power capacity in Kenya.
