The head of South Africa-based Sygnia Asset Management, Magda Wierzycka and Forensics for Justice (FFJ) have announced a one million rand ($85,192) bounty for information leading to the whereabouts and arrest of the Guptas and Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane Zuma. The bounty will be equally contributed by both offering parties.  FFJ is offering R100 000 for information on Ajay Gupta, R100 000 is being offered for information on his co-conspirators Dudzane Zuma, Atul Gupta and Rajesh Gupta. If all suspects are arrested a reward of R100 000 will be given out. Wierzycka said she’ll offer R100 000 for any information that will lead to an arrest. She will also give a reward of R200 000 to the first bodyguard currently with Ajay Gupta who will provide Crime Stop to give information on his location. R200 000 will also be given to the first accused in the Vrede Dairy Farm case who appeared in court to turn state witness.  However, some South Africans are reacting to this rewards for any information on the suspects. They see it as a waste of money at a time when a lot of South Africa are suffering from hunger. Some people have seen this age-old law enforcement tradition as the wrong move.  Magda – if yours and Mr O’Sullivan’s rewards expire – please help me rally the public to put up the funds. I’ll gladly be the first to make a deposit of R2000. I know many will follow and we can get the reward in position permanently. @thebouwer @MARviKmark @lindors77 — Scott Peter Gilbert (@ScottPGilbert) February 17, 2018   Not all South Africans see the reward as a bad idea  I’m adding R300,000 on that reward, making it R1.3m lets send a clear message that we now ready for a corrupt-free society. — Women In Forex (@QueenTwerkSA) February 17, 2018  Thank you Magda This is demonstrating your commitment to SA.
