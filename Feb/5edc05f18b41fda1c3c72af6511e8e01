The head of South Africa-based Sygnia Asset Management, Magda Wierzycka and Forensics for Justice (FFJ) have announced a one million rand ($85,192) bounty for information leading to the whereabouts and arrest of the Guptas and Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane Zuma. The bounty will be equally contributed by both offering parties.  FFJ is offering R100 000 for information on Ajay Gupta, R100 000 is being offered for information on his co-conspirators Dudzane Zuma, Atul Gupta and Rajesh Gupta. If all suspects are arrested a reward of R100 000 will be given out. Wierzycka said she’ll offer R100 000 for any information that will lead to an arrest. She will also give a reward of R200 000 to the first bodyguard currently with Ajay Gupta who will provide Crime Stop to give information on his location. R200 000 will also be given to the first accused in the Vrede Dairy Farm case who appeared in court to turn state witness. I am posting more rewards:
1. R200k to 1st bodyguard currently with Ajay Gupta who calls CrimeStop on 08600 10111 to advise of his location.
2. R200k to 1st accused in the Vrede Dairy Farm case (of the ones that appeared in court) to turn state witness. To help with legal fees. — Magda Wierzycka (@Magda_Wierzycka) February 17, 2018  However, some South Africans are reacting to this rewards for any information on the suspects. They see it as a waste of money at a time when a lot of South Africa are suffering from hunger. Some people have seen this age-old law enforcement tradition as the wrong move.   Plz pay for my fees instead pic.twitter.com/cipN9yxUil — I’m Xhosa Just So U know! (@BongeloSimphiwe) February 17, 2018  Not all South Africans see the reward as a bad idea Far more than Magda’s reward will be recouped when these crooks are brought to book. Their assets seized.  Justice will have been served.  The healing of our Nation can begin.  The money belonging to the people can b directed to the poorest, as it should be. — maeve joan king (@maevejoanking) February 18, 2018  I’m adding R300,000 on that reward, making it R1.3m lets send a clear message that we now ready for a corrupt-free society. — Women In Forex (@QueenTwerkSA) February 17, 2018  Thank you Magda This is demonstrating your commitment to SA. I applaud you — Carel van der Merwe (@CarelSupervan) February 17, 2018  Magda every time you step out and do something you get resistance.  That’s a sign of entrepreneurship and pioneering.  Bless you.  I hope we had more women with guys like you — Martino (@freequent007) February 17, 2018  However, the South African Ministry of police has discouraged people from offering rewards for the arrest of Ajay Gupta. “We are discouraging people to offer rewards. it might endanger the suspect, the lookalike and general public,” Police ministry spokesperson Vuyo Mhaga said.
