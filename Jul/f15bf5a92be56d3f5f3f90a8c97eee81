Childish Gambino’s “This Is America” video made a huge impact when it debuted in May, and as a result, we all got introduced to the “African dance queen choreographer” behind the incredible video, the powerhouse dancer Sherrie Silver. A few weeks later, the Rwandan-born 23-year-old—who has been going viral with choreography and tutorials on her YouTube channel for years—released a tutorial video to teach fans how to do some of the famous dance moves in the music video. She also choreographed a second dance for Glover when he performed the song on Saturday Night Live. Now, in a brand new video with Vogue, she shows off some more of her skills on the streets of Astoria, Queens, N.Y. to give a brief rundown of five of her favorite African dances for Vogue. In two minutes, Silver flawlessly breaks down five popular African dances—the Gwara Gwara, Hipjook, Neza, the Snakula, and the Shaku Shaku from South Africa, Central Africa, West Africa, and her native Rwanda—while “Tribal Mix” by Ugandan singer, Faizal Ddamba Mostrixx blares in the background. Some you’ve definitely seen being done before, but now, thanks to Silver who of course, does it all in designer clothing—including pieces from Jade Swim, Nike, Nφdress, and Araks—we can put a name to the dance and you can learn all five of them before you hit the dance floor this weekend. “Neza means ‘good’ in Kinyarwanda,” Silver told Vogue. And as for the good the choreographer hopes to put into the world, it’s to “take Afro dance and Afro culture to the world, and then take the world to Africa.”
