The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has advised the government of Mauritius to continue to focus on aviation as a strategic enabler of the country’s economic and social development. This is forecast to rise by 1.6 percent in 2018, and by 4.6 percent per annum, from 2018-2028, to MUR54.3 billion ($1,561.8 million) in 2028. The sector also contributed 22.6 percent of total employment (131,000 jobs). Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s Director General and CEO in a keynote address to Aviation Day Mauritius which is marking the 50th year of Mauritian independence stressed the critical role that aviation plays as a pillar of the Mauritian economy in its first 50 years post-independence. “And let’s look to the next fifty years with a comprehensive strategic focus on maximizing the benefits of aviation for this island nation,” said de Juniac. “The key elements of any aviation strategy are safety, global standards, competitiveness and cooperation. But Mauritius and other small island states have a critical competitive advantage in implementing an aviation strategy—and that is size. The country is small enough to rally the aviation universe—the airlines, the airport, the tourism infrastructure—to agree a strategy and to get it implemented quickly and nimbly,” he added. The IATA DG said that the goal of a comprehensive aviation strategy is to enable aviation drive economic and social development.
