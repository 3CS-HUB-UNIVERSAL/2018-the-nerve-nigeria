In the game, artiste Mr. Real’s Legbegbe hit single featuring Slimcase is the soundtrack to the celebratory dance. Prior to this latest edition of NBA 2K, basketball players in the game had the option of picking celebratory dance moves from the “Milly Rock”, “Nae Nae”, or “Dab”. The indigenous dance move made its debut on the football pitch first by Paul Pogba and his teammates at the World Cup; and then Alex Iwobi after scoring against Chelsea. NBA 2K19 is the 20th installment in the NBA 2K basketball simulation video game. The game will be officially released today, 11 September.
