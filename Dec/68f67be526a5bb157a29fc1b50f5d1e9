The global price of oil has slumped to 18 months low of $49.9 and this is not good news for Nigeria, which set its oil benchmark at $60 per barrel in the 2019 budget presented by the president a week ago. As at the time the budget was presented Brent closed at $57.24 on Wednesday and WTI crude at $47.21 falling below $50 per barrel for the first time in over a year.  From all indications, there is a lot of heightening fear that this budget may not be passed by the Senate due to the continuous fall in oil prices. According to reports, the fall in global oil prices was mostly linked to a fresh interest rate hike announced by the US Federal Reserve last week. The price of oil has plunged from a four-year high of $86 recorded in October on the prospect of a supply glut. However, investors are skeptical that the output cuts will be sufficient to prevent the growing supplies, especially from US shale. Industry experts believe that the market will be more stable in the first half of 2019 due to the deal between OPEC and its allies to cut output. The Head of Russian oil company Rosneft, Igor Sechin, predicted an oil price of between $50 and $53 in 2019, far below the four-year high of $86. Even though several bodies are optimistic that the price of crude would fare better in 2019, the only hope for Nigeria right now is for a price rebound of about $80 per barrel. This can only happen if the planned output cut by OPEC is successful and the cartel doesn’t lose the support of countries like Russia. On another note, the benchmark of $60 per barrel for Nigeria may be too ambitious, especially considering the country’s debt burden, huge recurrent expenditure and the unlikelihood of maintaining a daily production of 2.3 million barrels per day, another assumption on which President Buhari’s budget was based. OPEC also announced planned cuts in 2019, which will take some 40,000 barrels off Nigeria’s production.
