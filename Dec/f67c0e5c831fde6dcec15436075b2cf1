China’s Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co, whose subsidiary Congo DongFang International Mining (CDM), has been involved in several controversies around sourcing of cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), plans to invest $147.2 million to build a copper project in the country. Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Co said in a filing to the Shanghai stock exchange on Tuesday that the project will be located in the Lukuni region in the south of DRC, and will have annual electro-deposited copper production capacity of 30,000 tonnes. The new copper project is expected to launch by September 2019, subject to approvals from Chinese authorities. The investment will be made through CDM, which a joint Amnesty International and African Resources Watch report said sources cobalt from primitive “artisanal” mines in DRC where worker protections is poor and child labour has been employed. Apple said it sources about 20 percent of the Lithium in its batteries from Huayou Cobalt. However, after the controversies surrounding sourcing of the minerals became public, Apple said the company will start treating cobalt as a conflict mineral.
