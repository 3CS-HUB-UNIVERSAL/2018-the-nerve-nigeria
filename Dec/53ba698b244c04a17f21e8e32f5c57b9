The International Monetary Fund (IMF) board has approved a new $172 million loan programme for Sierra Leone, a country it reclassified as a “high risk” for debt distress as a result of the economic slowdown. The new 43-month loan programme is aimed at helping the West African country combat rising inflation and unimpressive economic growth. It comes after a $240 million financing plan that was suspended in February due to the country’s lack of commitment to reforms. “The main objectives of the current program are to safeguard macroeconomic stability, deepen structural reforms, and advance the country’s education for development and poverty reduction agendas,” the IMF said in a statement. The Sierra Leonean finance ministry and central bank have signed a memorandum of understanding, as part of the new deal, that the new government will cooperate with IMF conditions in terms of budget spending and accounting. Sierra Leone, which recovered from a civil war in 2002, is currently battling a rising inflation and slow economic growth, having experienced negative growth of 20.6 percent in 2015 after an Ebola epidemic hit the country at a time of falling commodity prices. Economic growth declined from 6.3 percent in 2016 to an estimated 3.75 percent this year. IMF representative Brian Aitken had during a visit to the country in October said Sierra Leone’s growth may not pass 4 percent this year. source: tradingeconomics.com
