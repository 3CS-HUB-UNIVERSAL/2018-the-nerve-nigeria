Former CEO of Africa Finance Corporation, Andrew Alli has been appointed chief executive officer of pan-African financial advisory firm SouthBridge Group. Alli’s appointment comes following a successful time at AFC, which he built into a robust Development Finance Institution focusing on African infrastructure, natural resources and heavy industry sectors. As AFC CEO, the corporation made cumulative investments of over $4 billion in 30 African countries and achieved the second highest credit rating for an African lending institution. Donald Kaberuka, former president of the African Development Bank (AfDB), who is now Chairman and Managing Partner at SouthBridge Group, while welcoming Alli to SouthBridge, expressed confidence that he is the man to provide the leadership SouthBridge needs for “the next level”. Responding, Andrew Alli said SouthBridge is an excellent platform through which he can continue to contribute towards the development of Africa “by building up a strong private sector and strengthening sovereigns”. “I look forward to working with […] Partners and staffs of SouthBridge to build a landmark African institution.” SouthBridge, which works to connect global pools of capital to African corporations and innovations, operates from Kigali, Abidjan, Paris and London.
