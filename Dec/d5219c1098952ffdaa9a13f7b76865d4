In light of a report published by campaign group Global Witness, saying that oil and gas multinationals Royal Dutch Shell and Eni’s alleged involvement in a 2011 fraudulent deal may cost Nigeria $6 billion, the government has filed a $1 billion claim against both companies. Nigeria lodged the claim in a UK High Court on Wednesday 12 December, alleging that the money used in a 2011 deal (OPL245) to acquire an oil exploration license in the Gulf of Guinea was paid to a company called Malabu, controlled by Nigeria’s former oil minister Dan Etete. Etete is the suspected mastermind in the 2011 deal that is considered the most corrupt deal in the history of the oil industry, he is a convicted money launderer who served under Nigerian dictator General Sani Abacha. Nigeria alleges that the funds were used for “bribes and kickbacks” because Shell and Eni assisted corrupt Nigerian government officials to breach fiduciary duties in the deal. According to Tom Hibbert, a solicitor representing the Nigerian government, “the claim reflects the determination and ongoing efforts of Nigeria to recover the very significant sums lost to corruption and the unlawful activity of Shell and Eni in this transaction.” Shell and Eni had denied and still denies any wrongdoing, stating that they made the payments into a legitimate government account. However, Finance Uncovered and Global Witness, an investigative journalism network dedicated to exposing corruption and environmental abuse, discovered internal Shell emails showing that senior Shell executives were aware that the $1.1. billion it and Eni were paying in 2011 would go to Etete. Meanwhile, Shell and Eni still reiterate that they are innocent. “We maintain that the 2011 settlement of long-standing legal disputes related to OPL 245 was a fully legal transaction with Eni and the federal government of Nigeria, represented by the most senior officials of the relevant ministries,” Shell’s spokesperson stated.
