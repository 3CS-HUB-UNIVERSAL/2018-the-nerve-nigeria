The anti-austerity and anti-capitalist yellow vest protest in France has led to a red vest movement in Tunisia, Gilet Rouge, which aims to give young people dignity and the right to a dignified life. According to Iranian Press, young Tunisian activists published a statement on various social media websites officially announcing the formation of the ‘red vest’ movement, calling for change and reforms in Tunisia. The group which has already taken to the streets says it is fighting corruption while denouncing the unclear vision of the current political class and the gap between the political class and the Tunisian people. The red vest movement is not the first call for change in Tunisia this year. Since the beginning of 2018, protests relating to the cost of living and taxes have erupted in the country. Even an alliance of leftist opposition parties, the Popular Front, also called for continued protests against the government’s “unjust” austerity measures. In December 2017, Tunisia announced an increase in fuel prices by 2.85 percent to rein in the budget deficit, the second increase in six months. In response to the law, protests on raised taxes on gasoline, phone cards, housing, internet usage, hotel rooms and foods such as fruits and vegetables, began in the country in January 2018. Like the yellow hazard vest in France which has become a symbol of an uproar over rising fuel prices, the high cost of living and a disproportionate burden of the government’s tax reforms that fall on the working and middle classes, the red vest movement is symbolic and has cultural implications. Red symbolises sin, guilt, passion, blood and anger. The organisers of the red vest movement noted that the protest would be peaceful, open to all and will have regional and local coordinating groups throughout the country.
