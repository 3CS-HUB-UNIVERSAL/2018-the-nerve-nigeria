More than 43,700 vulnerable rural households in Senegal will benefit from a $72.4 million programme that aims to improve food and nutrition security and incomes of smallholder crop and livestock farmers in four regions of Senegal, where the agriculture sector is extremely vulnerable to climate change. The financing agreement for the Agricultural Development and Rural Entrepreneurship Programme – Phase II (PADAER-II) was signed by correspondence by Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD and, Amadou Ba, Minister of Finance of the Republic of Senegal. The financing of the programme includes a $46.3 million loan and $0.5 million grant from IFAD. It will be cofinanced by an OPEC Fund for International Development grant ($10 million), the Government of Senegal ($9.5 million), the local communities and the beneficiaries themselves ($6.1 million). Due to the vulnerability of the Senegalese agriculture sector to climate change, poor rural people who depend on small farms for their food and income are at risk. PADAER-II will contribute to reducing poverty among the households in Kédougou, Kolda, Matam and Tambacounda regions in Senegal by integrating them with profitable and diversified value chains. It also aims to create permanent and well-paying jobs for rural people living in the programme area, and to ensure that at least 50 percent of the programme’s participants are women and 50 percent are young people. Since 1981, IFAD has financed 17 rural development programmes and projects in Senegal at a total cost of $514.2 million, with an IFAD investment of $269.1 million. These projects and programmes have directly benefited nearly 500,000 rural households.
