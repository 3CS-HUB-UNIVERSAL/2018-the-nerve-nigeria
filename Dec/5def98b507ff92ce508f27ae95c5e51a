One of Nigeria’s richest men Femi Otedola is selling his 75 percent stake in Forte Oil where he is also chairman, according to a statement by the company. Otedola became the company’s chairman in 2007 when it was still Africa Petroleum after acquiring a controlling stake in the business. After helping the oil firm return to profitability, he led a rebranding and restructuring effort birthing Forte Oil. A local oil firm Prudent Energy is taking up Otedola’s 75 percent direct and indirect shareholding in Forte Oil. Forte Oil explained that its chairman’s decision was to enable him pursue business opportunities in refining and petrochemicals. It is, however, unclear why Otedola is not getting into refining through Forte Oil which has been reported in the past to be striking a strategic partnership for local refining of petroleum products. If Otedola eventually sets up a refinery in Nigeria, he will be joining the country’s richest man Aliko Dangote whose refinery is expected to be ready by 2022. Nigeria produces about 2 million barrels of crude per day but its three refineries are not working at full capacity, forcing the country to import finished products from crude that may cost as much as N100 billion ($275.5 million) per month. However, the country’s private sector has been ramping up value addition efforts in recent times, despite difficulties.
