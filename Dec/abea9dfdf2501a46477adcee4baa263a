While GFG Alliance, owned by Britain’s wealthy Gupta family awaits regulatory approval for the acquisition of  Diamond Bank UK (DBUK), Nigeria’s Diamond Bank Plc, today, confirmed that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has approved its application to operate as a National Bank. If approved by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the UK, DBUK will be renamed the British Commonwealth Trade Bank (BCTB) and will focus on supporting trade in developing economies, particularly within the Commonwealth while Diamond Bank Plc will cease to operate as an International Bank. According to the bank, the re-licensing as a National Bank supports the Bank’s objective
of streamlining its operations to focus resources on the significant opportunities in the Nigerian retail banking market, and the economy as a whole. The bank, which currently struggles with weakened solvency, governance tensions and foreign currency liquidity challenges, hopes to use proceeds from the sale of DBUK to pay off its $200 million Eurobond. Late last month, Diamond Bank told Bloomberg that it was confident it can meet its obligations as it is in talks with development finance institutions and multilateral agencies for funds to help it meet the Eurobond repayment. In November, Diamond bank was the worst performer on Nigeria’s all-share index, with a reported a pre-tax loss of N9.01 billion ($24.68 million) in its 2017 full year financial results as against a profit after tax of N3.49 billion ($9.56 million) in 2016. Even ratings agency, Moody’s Investor Service, downgraded the baseline credit assessment (BCA) of the Bank to caa3 from caa1. Just last week, the bank was among the top 10 decliners on the Nigerian stock market with a 31.58 percent decline in shares. However, its renewed focus on the local retail banking segment, its strength from inception, is expected to save the bank from its current struggles and help stabilize it.
