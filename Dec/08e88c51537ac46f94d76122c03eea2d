After settling a row with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for alleged illegal repatriation of funds, the shares of South African telecoms giant MTN South Africa has increased by over eight percent to R93 per share after losing almost five percent in the past weeks. In the past four months, the telco has been in court with the CBN for illegally repatriating $8.1 billion in dividends paid by the firm between 2007 and 2015 to South Africa. This issue sent the shares of MTN down to about 20 percent which is its lowest since 2009. Apart from making a case with MTN, the CBN also fined the four banks that helped in repatriating the funds. Standard Chartered Bank was fined N2.4 billion, Stanbic IBTC Bank N1.8 billion, Citibank N1.2 billion and Diamond Bank N250 million. Although the firm denied any wrongdoing, it opted to settle out of court with the CBN. According to Reuters, after MTN provided documents, the central bank concluded that it was only one 2008 private placement of about $1 billion that was irregular. MTN agreed to pay $52.6 million as a “notional reversal” of this transaction. It is worthy to note that MTN has ongoing claims of about $2 billion on tax arrears for the importation of foreign equipment and payments to foreign suppliers over the last 10 years. MTN Nigeria, the biggest operator in the country with 52.3 million users have had a series of issues in Nigeria, which accounts for one-third of its annual core profits. It also comes two years after the firm paid $1 billion for failure to disconnect subscribers who were not adequately registered despite numerous warnings by the regulatory body urging its compliance. The fine caused MTN Nigeria’s first ever annual loss. The fine was initially N1.04 trillion but it was reduced significantly with terms mandating the company to list its shares on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) and offer a formal apology to the government and the citizens within a month of the execution of the agreement.
