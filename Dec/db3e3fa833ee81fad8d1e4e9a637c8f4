A South African high court has ruled that former president, Jacob Zuma must pay his own legal bills for his corruption case. The court also asked Zuma to repay the State for illegally using taxpayers’ funds to defend corruption and fraud cases against him. “The state is not liable for the legal costs incurred by Zuma in his personal capacity in criminal prosecutions against him, and in any civil litigation related or any other associated legal costs,” the Pretorian court deputy judge, Aubrey Ledwaba said. South Africa had previously struck a deal with Zuma and President Cyril Ramaphosa had noted that the State Attorney decided that it was appropriate for the state to pay for Zuma’s legal fees but that decision has been declared unlawful, illegal and invalid by the court. “Like all other accused persons in South Africa is thus entitled to be represented by a legal practitioner using his own resources, or those offered by the Legal Aid Board,” Ledwaba stated. With the ruling, Zuma is required to repay all the legal fees the country spent on him since his criminal trial began in 2005. He is mandated to repay the funds he used for all the civil litigations he undertook to ensure that all charges against him were dropped as well as the legal fees incurred during the nine-year battle with the Democratic Alliance (DA) political party to force the National Prosecution Authority (NPA) to the reinstate criminal charges against him. Zuma is facing 16 charges relating to corruption, money laundering, and racketeering, in connection with 783 questionable payments he received for an arms deal. On the eve of the country’s 2009 election that brought Zuma to power, the $2.5 billion arms deal charges were dropped but were reinstated in 2017 after a court ruled that the decision to drop the charges was irrational.
