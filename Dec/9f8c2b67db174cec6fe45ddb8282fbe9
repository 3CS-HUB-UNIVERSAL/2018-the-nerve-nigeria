Leading utilities company Eranove Group has signed a concession agreement with the government of Ivory Coast for financing, design, construction, operation and maintenance of a new power plant with an installed capacity of 390 MW in Jacqueville a town near Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s commercial capital. “This power plant is part of the State’s ambition to strengthen the country’s electricity production capacity through new units operated by experienced private partners to enable Côte d’Ivoire to double its energy capacity to 4,000 MW by 2020 and to consolidate its position as an energy hub in the region,” explains Mr Abdourahmane Cissé, Ivory Coast’s Minister for Petroleum, Energy and Renewable Energies, who together with the Minister of Economy and Finance, Mr Adama Koné and the Secretary of State to the Prime Minister in charge of the Budget and State Portfolio, Mr Moussa Sanogo, signed the agreement with Eranove on behalf of the government. According to a statement by Eranove, the plant in Jacqueville reflects the government’s ambition to generate industrial activities outside Abidjan, in order to create jobs and better distribute the country’s economic development geographically. The plant, named Atinkou will undertake a technological leap by introducing the first Class F gas turbines in Sub-Saharan Africa, which will enable it to produce more electricity without additional gas consumption. The cost of producing electrical energy is thus optimized and the environment is preserved by reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. The Atinkou project will provide 2,500 direct jobs during the construction phase and 100 direct jobs during the operation phase.
