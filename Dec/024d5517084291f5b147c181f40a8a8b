South Africa is out of recession as its economy grew 2.2 percent quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter of 2018, beating expectations, as the manufacturing and agricultural sectors of the economy accelerated. Africa’s most advanced economy had contracted by 0.7 percent in the second quarter, owing to declines in the agricultural, transport and retail sectors. Manufacturing grew by 7.5 percent, while agriculture grew by 6.5 percent. However, mining contracted by 8.8 percent. Several analysts, while predicting a third quarter growth for South Africa, did not see the economy growing beyond 2 percent, raising hopes that the South African economy could finish stronger than expected. Following its second quarter economic contraction, President Cyril Ramaphosa had announced he would turn things around through a plan which will include the reprioritisation of the current budget and the establishment of an infrastructure fund. He said the plan would ignite recovery, restore investor confidence and prevent job losses. Government expenditure expanded by 2.2 percent from a growth 0.8 percent in the previous quarter. Household expenditure also increased by 1.6 percent in the third quarter after contracting by 1.1 percent in the previous three months.
