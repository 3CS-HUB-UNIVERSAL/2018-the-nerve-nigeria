Nigeria’s Wakanow Limited has secured an investment of $40 million from global alternative asset manager The Carlyle Group. The online travel agency focused on West and East Africa, with principal operations in Nigeria. Carlyle’s equity investment in the leading travel business came from its Sub-Saharan Africa fund which has been used to invest in several entities across Africa, including Nigeria’s Diamond Bank. Although details of the investment was not disclosed, Mayowa Ayodele, Chief Investment Officer of Platform Capital, one of Wakanow’s lead investors, said it will be used to “strengthen Wakanow’s market position, accelerate innovation, deepen its systems and processes to realize the vision of a truly world class online travel agency with African roots”. Co-Founder and CEO of Wakanow, Obinna Ekezie expressed excitement at the new investment, stating that “Carlyle’s global footprint and scale as well as its extensive experience and network in the online travel sector will help us to further develop our offerings and broaden our customer base”. Since disrupting the travel market in 2009, Wakanow has grown to become one of West Africa’s largest full-service online travel companies. It also operates a network of traditional brick-and-mortar travel centres and has operations in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, UAE and the UK. With Carlyle’s prior experience investing in travel companies such as C-trip in China and Vasco Turismo in Peru, Wakanow has the right partner in the asset manager. Idris Mohammed, Managing Director, The Carlyle Group said he expects Wakanow’s impressive growth to continue, as it benefits from an expanding middle class across Africa. Also, as internet penetration and mobile connectivity grows, Wakanow will be able to deliver on its vision for growth and expansion.
