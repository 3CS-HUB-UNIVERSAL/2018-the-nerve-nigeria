Chelsea winger Victor Moses joined the Super Eagles in 2012, making 37 appearances and scoring 12 times since making his debut, however, it seems like the end of the road for the football player. Moses revealed on Twitter and Instagram that he’s stepping aside to focus fully on his family and club career. The former Stoke City, West Ham and Liverpool player had previously represented England up to Under-21 level, while coming through the ranks at Crystal palace. Moses won the Africa Cup of Nations with Nigeria in 2013, and represented the nation at two World Cups, in 2014 and 2018. “I have experienced some of the best moments of my life wearing the Super Eagles shirt and have memories with me that will last a lifetime,” he said. “However, I feel that now is the right time to step away in order to be able to focus fully on my club career and young family, as well as to allow the next generation the opportunity to step up and to flourish. “It’s meant the world to me and my family and I will always be a proud Nigerian supporting the team. Thank you for the memories and good luck to the team for the future,” Moses said while thanking Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, the coaching staff, Nigerians for their support and opportunity given him while playing for the national team. Commenting on Moses’s decision, former Super Eagles coach and captain Christian Chukwu told Vanguard Nigeria that the retirement of Nigerian born Chelsea player, Victor Moses, from international football was a matter of decision and not age. “Victor Moses is a very vibrant and young player, so he has the right to take decisions for himself. “He knows his body more than any person, therefore, it is best known for him why he retired and we wish him well,’’ Chukwu said.
