The plan is to launch a full service digital bank and disrupt banking in South Africa. Financial performance According to CBA’s 2018 financial results for 2018, TymeDigital posted a net loss of A$78 million ($57.8 million) for the financial year and its non current assets have been impaired by A$91 million ($67.5 million).
