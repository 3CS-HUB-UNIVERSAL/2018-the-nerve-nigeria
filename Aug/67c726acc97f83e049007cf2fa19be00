Ramatu Go Box, an informative short documentary, highlights West Africa’s well-known boxing community (Bukom) through the eyes of one of their up and coming female fighters, Ramatu Quaye. In the film directed by London-based producer and director Adu Lalouschek, and Alex Wondergem who has spent the majority of his life in Accra—both of mixed-Ghanaian descent, Quaye’s raspy, determined voice takes us through Jamestown where she’s from, what boxing means to her and the community, and where she’s determined to go with boxing. The increase of women who have gained interest for the sport and the shifting perspectives of those who looked down on its professional capacity are also shown in the 3-minute documentary. Jamestown, the renowned boxing district of Accra, Ghana, is known for producing the likes of Azumah Nelson, a former Ghanaian professional boxer. Widely considered the greatest African boxer of all time, he is currently the 17th greatest pound for pound boxer of all time in Boxrec’s ranking, once holding the WBC featherweight title and the WBC super featherweight title twice. “Boxing shaped me, it shaped my life,” Quaye says in the film. “If you touch me, you no go free.” Ramatu Quaye is on the Ghanaian national boxing team and hopes to bring home a medal one day.
