Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo has sacked Energy Minister Boakye Agyarko. In a statement on Monday, signed by Director of Communications Eugene Arhin, the president asked Agyarko to hand over his office to the minister of Lands and Natural Resources, John Peter Amewno, without stating any official reason for his sack. Media reports, however, said Agyarko lost his job following a supposedly renegotiated deal with United Arab Emirates-based AMERI Energy to operate a 300MW emergency power plant. The presidency had reportedly claimed that Agyarko misled the government. With calls for his sack or resignation rising, the president opted for the former. Meanwhile Ghanaian author and journalist Manasseh Azure Awuni has raised several questions following Agyarko’s sack, maintaining that there was no way the minister could have misled the government. “The government renegotiated a terrible deal and submitted it to parliament. The citizens (not spectators) rose against it. The government appeared embarrassed and decided to withdraw the deal. The government should have been honest enough to tell us that it had listened to our concerns and decided to withdraw the deal,” Awuni stated. He described as laughable the claim that Agyarko misled the government, asking; “If the public had not resisted this deal, would anybody have suggested that the president was misled? When the deal first emerged the government defended it only to turn around to say the President was misled? Again, how exactly did Mr. Agyarko mislead President Akufo-Addo?” Power cuts have intensified in Ghana in recent years, mostly due to a drop in gas supply and demand frequently surpassing supply.
