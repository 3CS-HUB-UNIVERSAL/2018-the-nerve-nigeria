The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects job opportunities in the aviation sector to increase tremendously in the coming years. According to a report of a global survey of Human Resources professionals in the aviation industry commissioned by the body, an average of 75 percent growth is expected in ground operations, customer services and cabin crew jobs over the next two years. “It is an exciting time to be in this business,” said Guy Brazeau, IATA’s Director of Training and Consulting. “We were really looking forward to receiving the results of this industry survey and we hope it can be helpful to guide HR professionals in their decisions regarding staffing planning, training opportunities and areas to focus on as our industry grows to unprecedented levels.” IATA expects 7.8 billion passengers to travel in 2036, a prediction based on a 3.6 percent average Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) noted in the release of the latest update to IATA’s 20-Year Air Passenger Forecast.

An increase in the number of people traveling by air will lead to airlines increasing their fleet, destination and workforce. The report is, therefore, a deep look into how HR decision-makers were managing the retention, training and recruiting of skilled professionals to fill the anticipated job gaps. Respondents to the survey which formed the report were from airlines, airports and ground service providers, spanning all geographic regions and representing a range of organizational size. About 48 percent of the respondents report that finding new talent is a challenge, both because of the lack of availability of candidates with the right skill levels and qualifications as well as, in some cases, salary demands of new applicants. The report is particularly important for Africa where unemployment remains high and some employers claim job seekers are in many cases unemployable. It highlights the skills hiring managers in the aviation industry are looking for.
