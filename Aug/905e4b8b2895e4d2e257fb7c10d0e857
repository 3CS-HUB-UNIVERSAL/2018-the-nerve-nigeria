Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has died. He was 80. According to a tweet by his foundation, the Nobel Peace Laureate passed away peacefully on Saturday after a short illness. “His wife Nane and their children Ama, Kojo and Nina were by his side during his last days,” the foundation said in a statement. “Wherever there was suffering or need, he reached out and touched many people with his deep compassion and empathy.” Annan, who was the first UN Secretary General to be appointed from within the United Nations, served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN) from January 1997 to December 2006, becoming a co-recipient of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize. Until his death, Annan was the founder and chairman of the Kofi Annan Foundation, as well as chairman of The Elders, an international organization founded by Nelson Mandela. The Kumasi, Ghana-born diplomat was a shinning light for Africans and a guiding force for good. As UN Secretary-General, Annan reformed the UN bureaucracy; worked to combat HIV, especially in Africa; and launched the UN Global Compact. In his statement, current UN Secretary General António Guterres, sends his condolences in a statement. “In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations,” Guterres said in the statement. “He rose through the ranks to lead the organization into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination.” Also published on Medium.
