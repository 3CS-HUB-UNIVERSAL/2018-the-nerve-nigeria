Panafrican banking group Oragroup plans to raise 56.92 billion CFA francs ($101 million) through the largest ever initial public offering (IPO) on the Abidjan Stock Exchange Bourse régionale des valeurs mobilières (BRVM), the company said on Friday. The money raised will be used to consolidate growth. The group, which operates in 12 countries across West and Central Africa, will list 20 percent — 6.1 million new shares and sell 7.8 million existing shares — of its equity at a price of 4,100 CFA francs per share, while the Group’s other current shareholders will keep 80 percent of the capital. Pan-African investor Emerging Capital Partners (ECP) will remain the majority shareholder with over 50 percent of shares. “This capital increase will enable us to consolidate the group’s growth and support its development, including by making investments in digital banking, seizing growth opportunities in Central African countries, raising the group’s profile among the financial community and the general public and strengthen the equity of some subsidiaries,” said Binta Touré Ndoye, CEO of Oragroup. The company wants to be in the top 5 best-performing banks in each of the countries where it operates. At the end of 2017, Oragroup had a balance sheet total of CFAF 1,794 billion (2.72 billion euros), representing a growth of 45 percent since 2014. The company is planning for an annual increase of 5 percent of the dividends paid to its shareholders. “For all of these reasons, Oragroup is a market opportunity for institutional and individual investors seeking medium and long-term investments that are strategic, profitable and have strong growth prospects,” concluded Binta Touré Ndoye.
