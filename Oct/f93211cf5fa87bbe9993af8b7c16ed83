For his third studio album, Divide, British singer-songwriter, Ed Sheeran, visited Ghana last year and ended up writing a song in the Ghanaian dialect, Twi, with Fuse ODG. “Bibia Be Ye Ye” (which means “All Will Be Well”) quickly became a fan favourite upon the album’s successful release five months ago. The accompanying music video was shot entirely in Ghana, and has local residents of the country lipsyncing to his song about hope throughout the visual which can pass for a love letter to the West African nation. “Since it’s summer I wanted to put out a video for ‘Bibia Be Ye Ye’ that was made by a fantastic director called Gyo Gyimah and all filmed in Ghana,” Ed wrote on Instagram. He added, “I visited Ghana last year to make music with Fuse ODG and Kill Beatz, and whilst there was exposed to such wonderful culture, food, music and scenery. Me and Fuse wanted to showcase all of these things in a music video to show off the beauty of it.” Now, South Africa’s Ndlovu Youth Choir has teamed up with flutist and Grammy award winner Wouter Kellerman to render an excellent cover of another one of Ed Sheeran’s hit—Shape of You, this time in the Zulu language. Started in 2009, Ndlovu Youth Choir sing “Afro-pop classics to South African traditional music as a professional music ensemble. “Members are selected by audition from the young people from the Ndlovu Care Group,” information below the Youtube video says. The community program provides healthcare, early childhood education, and after-school activities to rural Moutse in Limpopo, South Africa. Dressed up in their traditional attire, we dare say the choir’s take—a melodious melting pot of highs and lows—is even better than the original. Ed Sheeran is headed to SA on 2 December for the Global Citizen festival headlined by Beyoncé, returning for his first tour in March next year .
