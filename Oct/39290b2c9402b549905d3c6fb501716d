Ethiopia has opened up to the whole of Africa as reforms continue under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed who has promised to take the necessary policy decisions and produce fast economic growth. “Consistent with PM Abiy Ahmed’s vision of a closer and full regional integration in Africa — where minds are open to ideas and markets are open to trade, Ethiopia will start on arrival visa to all Africans starting from November 9, 2018,” said Fitsum Arega, Chief of Staff of the Ethiopian Prime Minister’s Office. The new move is significant for Ethiopia whose airline popular known as Ethiopian, the largest in Africa, has a hub at the capital city of Addis Ababa’s Bole International Airport, through which it can boost tourism in the country. African travelers can now easily add the ancient city of Addis to their itinerary which the European Council on Tourism and Trade named the number one tourist spot in the world in 2015. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, the direct contribution of Travel & Tourism to Ethiopia’s GDP was ETB49.1 billion ($2 billion), 2.7 percent of total GDP in 2017 and is forecast to rise by 6.7 percent in 2018, and to rise by 4.9 percent per annum, from 2018-2028. The new move increases the sector’s growth potential. Ethiopia had earlier shown readiness to open up to the continent to drive trade and investment by signing the Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) in Rwanda. However, the country is yet to ratify the agreement as negotiations over the details continue. Only Kenya, Rwanda, eSwatini, Chad, Niger, Guinea, Ghana and just recently South Africa, have ratified the ACFTA. The agreement needs to be ratified by 22 countries before it comes into force.
