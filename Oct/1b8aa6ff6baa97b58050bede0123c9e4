Since the first edition held in 1965, nine countries have hosted the All-Africa Games so far. The All-Africa Games (AAG), a regional multi-sport event held every four years (one year before the Olympic Games), contribute to the promotion of the Olympic spirit and stand as a major rendezvous for African athletes. While Casablanca, Morocco has been scheduled to host the 2019 edition (replacing Malabo, Equatorial Guinea), Ghana Olympic Committee President, Ben Nunoo Mensah, has confirmed Ghana’s hosting right for the 2023 All-Africa Games. It will be the first time Ghana hosts the All-Africa Games. The Ghana Olympic Committee revealed that the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA) selected the country after also receiving bids from Nigeria and Burkina Faso. “Technically, Ghana has won the bid for the 2023 African Games but we should wait for the delegation to return and do the formal announcement,” Mr. Nunoo Mensah said while speaking to Accra-based Happy FM. “Egypt were the biggest threat to Ghana winning the bid but the ministry put up a good bid.” Egypt remains the most successful country in the All-Africa Games having won 1362 medals in total. Ghana, which has participated in 11 All-Africa Games and holds the ninth-highest number of medals, will join the likes of Congo Brazzaville, Mali, Nigeria, Algeria, Kenya, Egypt, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Mozambique as the only countries to have hosted the event.
