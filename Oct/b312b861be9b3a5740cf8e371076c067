Ethiopian diplomat Ambassador Sahle-Work Zewde has been sworn in as Ethiopia’s first female president just days after some 10 women were appointed as ministers in Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s reshuffled cabinet. Zewde’s appointment comes after President Mulatu Teshome resigned after five years as president of the Horn of African state. The position of the president is largely a ceremonial one, with the office of the Prime Minister exercising executive powers. Presidents are elected by the House of Peoples’ Representatives for six years, with a two-term limit. Zewde was appointed in June by UN Secretary-General António Guterres as his Special Representative to the African Union and Head of the United Nations Office to the African Union (UNOAU) at the level of Under-Secretary-General, succeeding Haile Menkerios, among different positions she has held in the UN. As an Ethiopian diplomat, Ambassador Sahlework Zewde served as Director-General for African Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ethiopia as well as Ethiopian Ambassador to France. From 1993 to 2002, she served as Ambassador to Djibouti and Permanent Representative to the Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD), and to Senegal, with accreditation to Mali, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Gambia and Guinea. She will be missed by the UN where she has worked hard to help the international body achieve its goals in Africa. She has also been a shining light for women in Africa. The swearing in of Zewde is the latest in a series of “right moves” which Ethiopia has witnessed since Ahmed, 41 became prime minister earlier in the year. Ahmed has ended a long-drawn dispute with Eritrea and freed many journalists and political prisoners arrested by previous administrations. Also published on Medium.
