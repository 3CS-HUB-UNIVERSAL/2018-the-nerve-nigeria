South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa will convene a gathering of top officials, business leaders, as well as labour and community organisations on Thursday (today) in a bid to find solutions to the country’s unemployment crisis. Unemployment in South Africa has remained high for decades, increasing to 27.2 percent in the second quarter of 2018. The country’s economy, the most advanced in Africa, also went into a technical recession last month, increasing the pressure on President Cyril Ramaphosa to turn around the economy. As part of efforts to save the day, Ramaphosa launched a stimulus plan that he believes will spur growth, drive job creation and retention. Discussions on how to achieve these will be the focus of a Jobs Summit, which kicks off today. In line with its National Development Plan, the South African government aims to raise employment by 11 million to 24 million by 2030. The signing of the Jobs Summit Agreement is expected to take centre stage on the first day of the two-day summit. The opening section is expected to kick off at 2pm SAST, with opening addresses from President Ramaphosa, the National Economic Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC) and the constituency leaders such as business, community and labour.
