The 6th Bi-annual premier gathering of champions conference, International Open Data Conference (IODC) will be in held in Africa for the first time and Kenya will play host. This was made known in Argentina, at the close of the 5th IOD conference. The bi-annual conference which is for champions of open data from Government, Civil society, Academia and innovators is held to increase collaboration and the impact of open data activities globally. It cuts across agriculture, health, education and gender and fiscal transparency. Previously, (the last 10 years) the conference was curated by Spain, International Development Research Centre (IDRC), the World Bank and the Open Data for Development Network (OD4D) but the bid for the 6th conference taking place in 2020 was won by Kenya, making it the first time the conference would be held in Africa. According to Kenya’s Deputy President, William Ruto, “The President and I are committed to the creation of an inclusive data ecosystem involving the government, the private sector, academia, civil society, local communities, and development partners that tackles the information aspects of development decision-making. We recognize that if Kenya is to move ahead, we must deliberately pursue collaboration between the government, academia, and entrepreneurs. It is no longer an issue of political will, but a matter of rational economic and political choice.” The next 2020 conference themed Bridging Data Communities is expected to bring over 3000 participants to Nairobi from over 100 countries, including 5o international technology companies ho will exhibit and probably invest in the African continent.
