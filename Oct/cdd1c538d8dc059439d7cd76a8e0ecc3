A Rwandan court, Friday, ordered the release on bail of Diane Rwigara, one of the most vocal critics of President Paul Kagame, who was disqualified from running against Kagame in the country’s 2017 election on technical grounds. Kagame won 98 percent of votes in the election. Weeks after she was disqualified, the activist was also detained and was charged with incitement and fraud, while her mother was charged with discrimination and sectarian practices and inciting insurrection.
