“This massive investment will include the local manufacturing of parts, maintenance, training facilities, creation of jobs, skills development, the achievement of a 65 percent local content, and it will promote black economic empowerment and support communities,” the Transport department said. “The plant will deliver two new trains by December 2018, an approximation of nine trains by March 2019 and an estimated total of 56 trains over the next two years thereafter if bulk service challenges are overcome,” the department added. Construction of the factory began in January 2016, with manufacturing activities starting in 2017. The project, the department said, will alleviate challenges of overcrowding and delayed arrival of trains and provide an affordable, efficient and reliable rail service for South Africans. The launch of the train factory is expected to create much-needed jobs in South Africa where unemployment is high, while attracting investment and boosting the economy of the country.
