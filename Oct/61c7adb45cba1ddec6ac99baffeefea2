Most countries in Africa don’t have an ice hockey team for obvious reasons, however, the Ice Lions—Kenya’s only hockey team—may have just given some nationals more reasons to get interested in the sport after playing their first proper game against another team in Canada. There’s only one ice surface or rink in the whole of East and Central Africa, and it is located at the Panari Sky Center Hotel in Nairobi. Here, the 12 players carried out mere inter-team drills twice a week on the 1,400-square-metre indoor rink. Sponsored by Canadian coffee chain, Tim Hortons, the team finally got to dress up in full gear for the first time to play on one of the best rinks in Canada, outfitted with new skates, sticks, protective equipment, and personalized jerseys. Not only that, they also got the chance of playing alongside two of the country’s biggest hockey NHL superstars, Sidney Crosby captain of the Pittsburgh Penguins and Nathan MacKinnon, alternate captain for the Colorado Avalanche.  “It is a dream to not only have the chance to play in Canada, but to play—for the first time—in full gear alongside two of the greatest players of the game,” said Benard Azegere, captain of the Kenya Ice Lions, to TorontoSun. “When we first started playing in Kenya, we didn’t even have full equipment, but now not only do we have that, we can say we’ve played a real game with some All-Star teammates.” The video has already garnered support and commendation on YouTube, and Twitter. Crosby said in a statement about the event said, “One of the things I love about hockey is how it’s able to reach so many people from so many countries around the world and bring them together.” Tim Hortons has also helped to fund a youth hockey league in Kenya.
