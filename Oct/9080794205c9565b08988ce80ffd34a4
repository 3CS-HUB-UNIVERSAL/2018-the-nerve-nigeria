Nigeria-based Oranto Petroleum is set to secure oil Blocks R5, R6, Dibella and Dallol located in Agadem Rift Basin, from Niger’s Ministry of Petroleum. The move is the latest by the oil firm owned by billionaire Arthur Eze, as it continues to expand its presence in Africa. “We greatly look forward to working with the government of Niger Republic as the country seeks to build its oil and gas portfolio. As a leading African independent with an expertise in frontier exploration, we believe the potential of Blocks R5, R6, Dibella and Dallol has yet to be fully explored, and we are eager to get to work,” said Eze. Oranto Petroleum, which also has oil assets in Nigeria, Liberia, Guinea, Gambia and the UK, signed an agreement with the Ministry Petroleum of the Republic of Niger, outlining its intention to sign production sharing contracts on Blocks R5, R6, Dibella and Dallol in the Tenere and Agadem Basins in the country. The company had in March last year signed an Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement (EPSA) with the South Sudan’s Ministry of Petroleum. It is also exploring for oil in Uganda and Zambia. According to the agreement signed in September between Prince Arthur Eze, Chairman of Oranto Petroleum, and H.E. Foumakoye Gado, Minister of Petroleum of Niger, Oranto Petroleum is to receive all technical data on the blocks. After a satisfactory review of the technical data, Oranto Petroleum will be granted the blocks under the terms outlined in the country’s petroleum code and as determined by its Ministry of Petroleum. Oranto Petroleum will be hoping for massive finds in blocks R5 and R6, bordering Savannah Petroleum’s Blocks R1 and R2, which have boasted several discoveries of oil in recent years. Also, the Agadem Rift Basin, in southeast Niger, was explored by the China National Petroleum Corporation, which made 97 discoveries from 127 exploration wells throughout the area.
