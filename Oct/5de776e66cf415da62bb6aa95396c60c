Africa is closer to having its continental free trade agreement enter into force, with the South African Parliament approving the country’s ratification of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The African Union’s Commissioner for Trade and Industry Ambassador Albert Muchanga made this known on Friday via Twitter. “Great news. Got notification from Chief Negotiator. South Africa Parliament has approved ratification of the #AfCFTA Agreement. Formal deposit to be done during side event at February 2019 @_AfricanUnion Summit. Momentum towards One African Market growing!” he tweeted. The move by South Africa makes it the 8th country to ratify the agreement. Fourteen more countries need to ratify the agreement for it to come into force. Forty-four members of the African had earlier in the year signed a framework agreement for an African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), with the primary aim of creating a single market. The agreement will cover a market of approximately 1.2 billion people and a gross domestic product (GDP) of over $3 trillion. Since the signing of the agreement in March, it has been open for country-level ratification which was started by Rwanda whose Lower House voted in favour of ratifying the AfCFTA on 24 April. Kenya and Ghana are also among the countries that have ratified the agreement. Fear of significant tariff revenue losses is one of the major reasons countries like Nigeria developed a cold feet, with the country’s President Muhammadu Buhari canceling an already scheduled trip to Rwanda to sign the agreement, at the last minute. However, there are several benefits from having and expanded market for goods and services which should not be ignored. With time, countries involved will be able to work out modalities that will make the agreement in the best interest of each nation. Africa can decide as one whether to eliminate all tariffs on intra-African trade or exempt sensitive products from tariff liberalization.
