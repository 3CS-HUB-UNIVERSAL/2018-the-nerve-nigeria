One of the most influential female black executives in the world Carla Harris has many sides to her. Apart from being the world famous Vice Chairman, Managing Director and Senior Client Advisor at Morgan Stanley, she is also an author of two books, Expect to Win (2009) and Strategize to Win (2014). She is a sought-after public speaker and an accomplished gospel singer with three albums to her name. At Morgan Stanley, she is responsible for increasing client connectivity and penetration to enhance revenue generation across the firm but she means much more to people who are not even connected to Morgan Stanley in any way; constantly doling out advice on leadership, success and diversity in the work place. Below are 12 of her recent quotes to start your day: Carla Harris will be in Nigeria this November for the CFA Society Nigeria’s Nigeria Investment Conference 2018 where she will be the lead anchor of the Women in Investment Management Workshop at the conference.
