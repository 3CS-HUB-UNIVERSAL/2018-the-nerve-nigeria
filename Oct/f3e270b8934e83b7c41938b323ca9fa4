Telecommunications giant MTN Nigeria appeared before a Federal High Court in Lagos on Tuesday for hearing in the suit filed by the telco to challenge the $8.1 billion that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) claimed was taken out of the country illegally. The CBN is the first defendant in the suit that also had the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN) as the 2nd defendant. MTN Nigeria’s team of 15 lawyers was led by Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN). Others include Prof Fabian Ajogwu (SAN), Mr Damian Dodo (SAN), Mr Adeniyi Adegbonmire (SAN), and Mr Bode Olanipekun (SAN). MTN is praying the court to declare that it is not liable to refund the repatriated sum to CBN as demanded by the apex bank. The teleco is urging the court to declare that that “the 1st defendant’s decision in its letter of August 28, 2018 with Ref No GBD/GOV/COM/DGF/118/121 addressed to the plaintiff and titled, ‘Investigation into the remittance of foreign exchange on the basis of the illegal capital importation certificates issued to MTN Nigeria Communications Limited’ was reached in breach of the plaintiff’s right to fair hearing.” Hence, MTN wants Justice Saliu Saidu to hold that the CBN “lacks the power to determine the civil obligations or penal liabilities of the plaintiff.” It wants the court to hold that the $8.1 billion demand was “illegal, oppressive, abusive, unauthorised and unconstitutional.” It also wants the court to void the September 3, 2018, letter written to it by the AGF demanding $8.1bn as “penalties for the offence of ‘infraction of forex remittances’.” Justice Saidu had since fixed 4 December, 2018 for hearing in the suit.
