Every year, Forbes goes in search of some of the brightest young entrepreneurs, leaders and billionaires of tomorrow to be featured in its 30 Under 30 list across the world. Forbes launched its 30 Under 30 list in 2011, and later expanded it to include Europe, Asia and Africa. This year, Forbes covered not 30, but 90 candidates who were chosen from three different categories—technology, business, and creative—and who are to be Africa’s future billionaires. The category  ‘Creatives’ features individuals that are making waves in their industries across the continent including Actress Thuso Mbedu, 26, South Africa; Supermodel Maria Borges, 25, Angola; Painter Eddy Kamuanga Illunga, 26, DRC; Rapper & Entrepreneur Cassper Nyovest, 27, South Africa; Poet & Author Koleka Putuma, 25, South Africa; Multidisciplinary Contemporary Artist, Stacey Gillian Abe, 27, Uganda; and Actress Nomzamo Mbatha, 27, South Africa alongside popular Nigerian artists Yemi Alade, 29, Davido, 25, and Wizkid, 27. Also on the list in the ‘Business’ category are Yannick Nzonde, 29, DRC—co-founder ATI Groupe; Leroy Mwasaru, 20, Kenya—founder, Greenpact; Ladipo Lawani, 29, Nigeria—founder, L&L Foods; Mwiya Musokotwane, 28, Zambia—founder, Thebe Investment Management; Thomas Duncan, 28, Namiba—Owner, Anticor; and Gisela van Houcke, 27, DRC—founder, Zuri Luxury Hair&Beauty.

Speaking with the Guardian Nigeria on the design of the cover, Graphic Designer Lucy Nkosi says, “I think it’s a very important cover because we wanted to show as many entrepreneurs as we could and we wanted to have some people from each category and this was the best way to do it … we want to inspire other people to want to be on the Forbes under 30 list.” The full list is available in the June copy of the Forbes magazine.
