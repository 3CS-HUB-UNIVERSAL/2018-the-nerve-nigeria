The Made In America music festival is known for its diverse line-up of artists who dominate the genres of hip-hop, rock, pop, R&B, latin, electronic among others. This year, Nigerian artist David Adeleke, popularly known as (Davido), has been listed among the performers for the 2018 “Made in America ‘’ Music Festival. 21-year-old Nigerian-Canadian artist, Odie, a producer and singer who infuses his Nigerian roots into hip-hop and R&B will also perform among other popular artists such as Afro-Latina singer Amara La Negra, Janelle Monáe, Nicki Minaj, Ty Dolla $ign, Rich The Kid, Miguel, Meek Mill, Diplo. Made in America is originally curated by Jay-Z. Formerly held in Los Angeles, the festival now takes place in Philadelphia. Last year’s festival had Nigeria’s Tiwa Savage and Maleek Berry performing, with Wizkid also on the lineup—but he failed to make an appearance. Davido, no stranger across international waters, has also just been nominated for “Best International Act” at the 2018 BET Awards. The concert, which is to be headlined this year by rappers Nicki Minaj and Post Malone, has been scheduled for 1 to 2 September at Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia, U.S.
