The Summer Youth Olympic Games (YOG), an international sports, education and cultural festival for teenagers, has set its flags in Africa for 2022. In February, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided that the 2022 edition should actively target an African nation to host the fourth edition of the Summer Youth Olympic Games. The IOC paved the way for the decision as members last month voted in favour of the African initiative following a recommendation from the Executive Board. An Olympic Games event has never been hosted in Africa, and the IOC hopes that a Youth Olympics could build a road to a summer Olympic Games on the continent. According to the official website of the Olympics, Nigeria is looking to pull this off in Abuja. While making the proposal to the IOC, the Minister of Youth and Sports, Solomon Dalung was positive the city will be ready to host the games by 2022. Botswana, Senegal and Tunisia are also in the race to become the first African country to win the hosting rights, making the four African National Olympic Committees (NOCS) which registered interest last month in hosting the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) 2022 In Africa. A new process for selecting a YOG host was announced on 29 May with the aim to simplify, streamline and ensure cost efficiency for the interested NOCs as it seeks to take one of its major events to Africa for the first time. The initial NOC Dialogue Phase will end in July when the IOC Executive Board will decide which interested parties will be invited to take part in the Candidature Phase, based on the feasibility reports and visits. The host for the YOG 2022 will be elected at the IOC Session in 8-9 October 2018 in Buenos Aires. The Argentine city will host the next edition of the summer YOG from 6-18 October. The event was previously held in Singapore in 2010, and Nanjing, China in 2014.
