The sixth edition of the DStv Delicious International Food and Music Festival will see neo-soul icon Erykah Badu headline at the Kyalami Grand Prix Circuit in Midrand on 22 and 23 September 2018. With hit songs “Bag Lady” and “Love Of My Life (An Ode To Hip Hop)”, the amazingly talented and unconventional artist is expected to bring in serious food for the soul. DStv Delicious International Food and Music Festival has become a favourite where great culinary creatives share their passions at the Delicious Mile: the festival’s Gourmet Street-Food Market. The festival is one of the biggest and most popular food and music festival in South Africa, with an estimated 40,000 people expected to attend over the Heritage Day long weekend. New Zealand’s young soul singer and multi-instrumentalist Jordan Rakei, who recently wowed local fans when he played his first-ever South African gig at The Cape Town Jazz Festival, will also join Badu at this year’s festival with other musical acts like DJ collective, Jazzanova, and the British acid jazz band, D’Influence. More acts are set to be announced in due course. The festival has hosted some of the biggest names including MasterChef SA Judge Pete Goffe-Wood, chefs Reza Mahammad, Siba Mtongana, and music legends including Chaka Khan, Jamiroquai, Hugh Masekela, De La Soul, Thandiswa Mazwai & Bongo Maffin, and Black Coffee. Festival director Lloyd Cornwall said there was no better way to celebrate Heritage Day than at the festival. “People want to go see high quality live music and enjoy amazing food at the same time. DStv Delicious International Food and Music Festival attracts an estimated 40000 visitors. “The visitors to the festival spend their money on the local food and drink outlets, which keeps the revenue with the local economy. We’re extremely proud that more than 80% of our supply chain is local,” he added.
