After starting her modelling career in 2015 by winning the Elite Model Look competition, fast rising Nigerian model Mayowa Nicholas has achieved yet another feat as she covers her first fashion magazine on the Vogue Germany July 2018 issue. The 20-year-old model who comes from Lagos has graced runways in Milan and York, despite her initial disinterest in the trends of designers or models in Nigeria’s fashion capital.  Since winning Elite’s Model Look competition in her home country in 2014, she’s made her way around the world and back, walking in major runway shows from Paris to Milan. International fashion powerhouses such as Miu Miu, Calvin Klein, H&M and many more, have been taken by the model’s poise, and perfect physique. Standing tall at 5’ 11”, she’s known as one of the most wanted faces right now, featuring in Miu Miu’s eyewear campaign, walking 43 shows between New York, London, Milan and Paris for S/S 17, and recently fronting a campaign for Calvin Klein. She has walked for Chanel, Margiela, Céline, Hermès, Prada, Lisa Folawiyo, Elie Saab, Loewe, Balmain, and Christian Dior, while also nailing campaigns with Saint Laurent and Dolce & Gabbana. Mayowa graces the cover of Vogue Germany’s July edition, wearing a red Christopher Kane dress. She was photographed by Philip-Lorca Dicorcia and styled by Phyllis Posnick, and according to Bazaar, “Not only does she have an incredible walk, but an attitude to match; she is one of the most passionate, fun and loveable models in the industry.”
