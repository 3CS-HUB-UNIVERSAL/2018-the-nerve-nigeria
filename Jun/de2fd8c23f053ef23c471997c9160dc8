Queen Elizabeth II has awarded World Heavyweight Champion Anthony Joshua an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE). The Nigerian-born boxer was awarded for his service to boxing in the United Kingdom on Friday as part of the 2018 honours of the Queen’s birthday. This is the second special recognition award won by the 28-year-old boxer from the UK in five years. The heavyweight world champion currently holds the WBO, WBA Super, IBF and IBO crowns in the boxing world. Five years ago, Anthony Joshua was awarded a Member of the Most Excellent Order of British Empire (MBE) for winning the super-heavyweight gold at London 2012 Olympics. Joshua was one of over 1000 people who received an award at the Queen’s birthday party last Friday. The British boxer is looking forward to a unification fight with American Deontay Wilder for the undisputed heavyweight world champion. If that happens, Joshua will become the second boxer in history to hold the title after Lennox Lewis, who defeated Evander Holyfield in 1999. Joshua became popular in Nigeria in 2017 when he defeated Ukrainian boxer Wladimir Klitschko at the Wembley Stadium in England. Multiple reports have it that Joshua was rejected by Nigeria when he sought to represent the country at the at the Olympics in 2007. He returned to England and represented the Great Britain, going on to win a gold medal. He is expected to face WBC champion, Deontay Wilder, with all his boxing titles at stake. Deontay Wilder and Anthony Joshua agreed to terms to world heavyweight unification fight in the UK scheduled to take place anytime from September to November.
