The president of Dangote Group and Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote on Thursday announced the successful inauguration of a multi-million naira rice processing plant in Hadin, Jigawa State. The mill has a capacity to process 16 metric tons of paddy rice per hour which will be worth N14billion in a year. This is in fulfillment of the company’s commitment toward making Nigeria self-sufficient in rice production. <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” data-lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>Today we celebrate another milestone in pursuance of our commitment toward making Nigeria self sufficient in rice production through the groundbreaking ceremony of Dangote Rice Limited state-of-the-art integrated rice mill project in Hadin, Jigawa State</p>&mdash; Aliko Dangote (@AlikoDangote) <a href=”https://twitter.com/AlikoDangote/status/969260999856488450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>March 1, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src=”https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8″></script> While speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony Dangote said that the commencement of the construction was the outcome of a series of events, which started from the signing of a $1billion deal with the Federal government for the integrated rice production in Kebbi, Sokoto, Zamfara, Kano, Niger, and Jigawa. This is the first mill in the series of five other mills that would be installed in Kano, Sokoto, Zamfara, Kebbi and Niger states. “We have continued to pioneer new approaches to empowering our primary stakeholders and our farmers, through the Dangote outgrowers programme thereby creating thousands of jobs, increasing incomes, poverty reduction in rural communities by providing high-quality agro-inputs, technical support and secured the market for farmers. Also, creating access to finance, mechanization and irrigation services so as to enhance agricultural productivity,” Dangote said. In 2016, the Dangote Rice limited started the outgrowers scheme with thousands of hectares of land in Hadejia, Jigawa State. They created over 10,000 direct and indirect jobs for farmers. “We have continued to pioneer new approaches to empowering our primary stakeholders and our farmers, through the Dangote outgrowers programme thereby creating thousands of jobs, increasing incomes, poverty reduction in rural communities by providing high-quality agro-inputs, technical support and secured the market for farmers. Also, creating access to finance, mechanization and irrigation services so as to enhance agricultural productivity,” he stated. The richest man in Africa further said that they are focused on engaging about 300,000 farmers in the region in the next 12 months when the rice mills are all functional. “We will also continue to launch massive agricultural projects across the country in rice and dairy farming. Our push for backward integration in providing our own raw materials on a massive scale has led to the planned investment of $4.6 billion over the next three years in sugar, rice and dairy production alone. This will eliminate the country’s reliance on imported materials and the foreign exchange headaches that come with it,” Dangote added.
