The international robotic competition scheduled to hold in the United states of America in April will be host to students from various countries including eight students from Grand Bassa County in Liberia. Aimed  at fostering innovation that spur young people’s interest and participation in science and technology, the international high school robotics competition combines the rigors of sport, science, and technology draws students from around the world who have interest in Science-Technology-Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). In a bid to boost standard education in the country which former president Sirleaf Johnson called ‘a mess’, the eight students who will be travelling to Louisville under the umbrella of Nyonblee Cares Foundation, will use their knowledge to expand innovative ideas like building cars, machines, and planes in Liberia. Prior to 2018, Liberia was ranked second highest among the 40 African countries that participated in the FIRST Global Challenge robotics competition and these Liberia students competing in this year’s competition, will be the second batch of students from the country to have participated in a robotic competition. However, there is still a challenge of insufficient funds as the Nyonblee Cares Foundation (NCF), over the weekend, featured the work implemented by Wahjay-STEM to raise additional funds for the students trip. In a statement to FrontPageAfrica, Senator Nyonblee Karngar Lawrence who has been behind the wheels assisting and propelling these students forward said “Our Wahjay-STEM board is truly honored for the support provided to implement robotics curriculum at the World-Wide Mission Academy via NCF and cannot wait for the second international competition that will be held Louisville, KY in April 2018.” “We want to show Liberia what a standardized curriculum in robotics can do for Liberia’s children,” Senator Karnga added. Participating in the robotic competition are students from USA, China, Korea, Canada and other developed countries.
