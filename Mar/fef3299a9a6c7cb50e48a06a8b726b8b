A groundbreaking South African director has been signed to direct the big-screen adaptation of Trevor Noah’s autobiography, “Born A Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood”, which reflected a combination of humor and love of family with the backdrop of apartheid.

Liesl Tommy, who was born in Cape Town, was unveiled to take on the role of the film’s director overnight with Kenyan actor, Lupita Nyong’o, sharing a gushing post explaining her own delight at the choice. The Oscar winner was announced in February to star as Trevor Noah’s mother, Patricia Noah, who was also elated when she heard the news. Nyong’o and Tommy have worked together before on a Broadway production titled “Eclipsed”, for which Tommy received a Tony award nomination in 2016 for Best Play Director. Tommy, who was the first woman of color to be nominated when she was shortlisted, was also pretty thrilled. “Never in a million years did I imagine I’d one day be directing the film of that book. I’ve spent many years working all over the world, to finally get to come home to South Africa to shoot a project like this is a dream come true.” the biopic director said. Tommy has worked on notable works including “Les Miserables”, “Ruined”, “Party People”, “The Good Negro”, and “Frozen” at the Disney California Adventure Park’s Hyperion Theatre. The film will be produced by Noah, Nyong’o’s Eba Productions, and Norman Aladjem, Derek Van Pelt, and Sanaz Yamin of Mainstay Entertainment. This is Noah’s first project with Viacom, the parent company of Comedy Central, and the movie will be released through their venture Day Zero Productions.
