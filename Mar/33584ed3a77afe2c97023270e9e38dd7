Growing up as a child in Nigeria, the assimilation of a certain set of survival skills are carefully woven into the fabric of those experiences with repercussions for laws broken by children in most homes. For Mother’s Day, 2018, Chris Ogunlowo, creative director of SO&U, came up with creative images that gave common household items their weaponry status as weapons of ‘factory reset’ used by Nigerian mothers to ‘correct’ a misbehaving child. Tools like ‘The Dunlop slippers’,‘The Broom’ and ‘The Spatula’ are regular household items which were highlighted and which asides from their original purpose of protecting the feet, keeping the house clean and making the common Nigerian dish, eba, continue to alternate as tools for discipline. For the majority, this curated list of designed manuals showing directions in detail, of how to use various household items as tools of ‘discipline’ brought a nostalgic smile to the corners of the lips with memories filled with the sound of your mother’s voice followed by a carefully chosen multipurpose tool. For others, especially those who didn’t experience this form of discipline but mostly got non-contact punishments for bad behaviour such as kneeling down and having toys or play time taken away, these set of ads may not sit well and would probably bring into question the mode of parenting being employed by previous generations and whether this constitutes for the physical and mental abuse of generations past. For most though, it was seen as humourous and as comic relief which strikes a comparison between both stages of life for the children who have now grown up, most, contributing additional i to the set of the images which went viral when shared on social media on Sunday. Chris Ogunlowo, creative director SO&U, in conversation with Farabale, said he was convinced that it would resonate because “we humorously whipped up nostalgic emotions since many grownups in African communities look back fondly on these corrective tools.” “I believe people like humour and nostalgia, he concluded.”
