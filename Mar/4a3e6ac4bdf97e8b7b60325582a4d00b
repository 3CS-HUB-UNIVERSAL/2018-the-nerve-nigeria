In the pursuit of restoring its ties with international community, Zimbabwe is having discussions on returning to the Commonwealth of Nations, according to the country’s foreign minister, Sibusiso Moyo. According to a transcript of the minister’s comments in parliament seen by Reuters on Thursday, Moyo noted that there is nothing holding Harare back from going back to the Commonwealth and stated that “in fact, there are necessary processes and consultations taking place.” In 2003, Zimbabwe’s former president Robert Mugabe led the nation’s exit from the Commonwealth, following the intergovernmental organization’s criticism over disputed elections and violent seizures of white-owned farms in the country. Following a de facto military coup that saw to the exit of Mugabe from the country’s presidency in November 2017, Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnanagwa wants the nation back in the Commonwealth. With the zeal to have the country on a good standing with international community, Mnanagwa revealed plans to ask Commonwealth, European Union and United Nations observers to oversee presidential and parliamentary elections this year; a determinant of the country’s future foreign relations. Committed to the institution of world peace, promotion of representative democracy and individual liberty, the Commonwealth includes 53 countries across all continents. The members have a combined population of 2.3 billion people, almost a third of the world population, of which 1.26 billion live in India and 94% live in Asia and Africa combined.
