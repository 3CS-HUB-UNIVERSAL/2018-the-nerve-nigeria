Growth revenues from Cargo export in the Democratic Republic of Congo has increased Tanzania’s already choked storage facility. Recently, Tanzania’s Dar es Salaam’s port which handles 90% of the countries cargo traffic, has witnessed a lot of discomfort as it attempts to accommodate increased Cargo exports from DRC. Following the increased trade volumes  from cargo exports between Tanzania and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which began years back, experts believe that DR Congo’s cargo to the East African nation will shoot up by 45 per cent, which is considered to be on a high end. DRC’s cargo growth brings a fortune for Tanzania as the East African country benefits from President John Magufuli schemes which ensures that Tanzania is a global hub for industry and Trade. Almost 35 percent of all cargo moving through the the countries Dar es Salaam’s is transit cargo and the country still struggles to secure adequate measures for global trade expansion. Tanzania which seeks expansion to enable the country handle more goods still lacks sufficient storage facilities such as importation receipts.
