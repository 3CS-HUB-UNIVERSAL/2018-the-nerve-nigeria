Over the weekend, Lagos, Nigeria, got its first dedicated Bridal Fashion Week, tapping into the multi-billion naira wedding industry in the country. Flamboyant wedding parties, popularly called “owambe”, happen every Saturday in the city. Brides and grooms, however, often look to foreign influences for unique wears. Call Her Classic Fashion agency presented Lagos Bridal Fashion Week (LBFW), a three-day showcase designed to cater to the needs of weddings and showcase the latest in bridal fashion by indigenous designers, with some international presentation. And this adds another branch to the progressive Nigerian fashion industry. Masterclasses with top bridal designers such as Hudayya, Mai Atafo, Andrea Iyamah, April by Kunbi, among others featured at the event, while attendees also had the opportunity to visit exhibition stands. There were also bridal consultation rooms where brides-to-be could speak to the designers. Speaking to the Guardian Nigeria, CEO of Call Her Classic, Ayomide Amosun-Dabiri, said the event would impact local designers, as they would have access to interact and learn from their foreign counterparts. “Also, because our local designers would be showcasing their works at the LBFW, it would bring more patronage to our local fashion industry while boosting tourism for the country.”

Showcasing the diverse talent inspired by the wedding culture both in Nigeria and internationally, the bridal showcase featured some really great designs. A few of them are pictured below.
