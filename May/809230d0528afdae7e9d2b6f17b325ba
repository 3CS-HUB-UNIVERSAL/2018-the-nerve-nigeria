Rwanda becomes an official tourism partner of English Premier League heavyweights Arsenal Football Club and to commemorate this partnership, the football club will have all their teams wear a ‘Visit Rwanda’ logo on their sleeves, Rwanda’s Development Board (RDB) states. The reason for the partnership, according to Vinal Venkatesham, Arsenal’s Chief Commercial Officer, is to bring Rwanda into people’s minds in a new and dynamic way. “Rwanda has been transformed in recent years and this is an exciting partnership that will see us support Rwanda’s ambition to build their tourism industry,” Venkatesham said. The three-year partnership will see the new ‘Visit Rwanda’ logo featured on the left sleeve of all first team, under-23 and Arsenal Women’s matches in the new season starting August. Arsenal players from the men’s and women’s teams will also visit the East African country and club coaches in the country will host coaching camps to support the development of the game for boys and girls in the country. As a win-win strategy, ‘Visit Rwanda’ logo will gain global exposure through branding on matchday LED boards, interview backdrops and the club’s stadium tour. Rwanda’s tourism offerings such as the National Parks as well as the investment opportunities in the country will be highlighted with this new partnership. In anticipation, Clare Akamanzi the CEO of Rwanda Development Board said the country is looking forward to welcoming more tourists and investors. “We’re thrilled to be partnering with Arsenal and showcasing the vibrancy and beauty of our country.  Rwanda is a country pulsing with energy, creativity and innovation.” Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame is an ardent Arsenal fan and does not miss a chance to shares his thoughts of the club on his Twitter handle.
