Ethiopia and the Netherlands have signed a seven-year agreement valued at £40 million (over $53 million) to build Ethiopia’s first specialized cardiac care centre, which will address the critical shortage of cardiology services in the East African country. This first of its kind project for Philips will ensure the global leader in health technology delivers a complete hospital solution for state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment of cardiac diseases that will cater to over 100 million Ethiopian citizens who currently have no access to a continually functioning cardiac centre, a bleak reality for a country with one of the highest prevalence of rheumatic heart disease. According to Ato Amir Aman, Ethiopia’s Minister of Health, “We want to transform cardiology care in Ethiopia, and in Philips we have a strong partner that understands our requirements and is able to provide a comprehensive hospital solution for state-of-the-art diagnosis and treatment of cardiac diseases, including capability building and skills transfer.” Meanwhile, Jasper Westerink, CEO of Philips Africa, said, “This is a unique project for Philips globally as we are creating an entire turnkey hospital solution.” Under the terms of the agreement, Philips will be responsible for the full turnkey design, construction, equipping and commissioning of the hospital location, as well as staff education and equipment maintenance for five years after completion. The cardiac centre, which is scheduled for completion in mid-2020, is expected to have the physical capacity to perform 500 surgeries, 1,600 cath lab diagnoses, and 500 cath lab interventions once operational. The cardiac centre will be a 7-story building covering 7,200 square meters with 3 operating rooms, 2 cath labs, 94 beds and full diagnostic and examination suites.
