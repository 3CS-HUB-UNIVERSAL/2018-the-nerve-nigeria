Microsoft in partnership with custom software application development company Techno Brain is launching its first African software testing centre in Kenya. According to Bamboo Sofola, partner director software engineering at Microsoft Corporation “Kenya is set to be the ultimate technology hub in Africa. Microsoft supports Kenya in that vision with global training and standards to up skill to global standards.” To launch its flagship Window operating system, and grow technology skills in Africa starting with Kenya, the multinational has decided to outsource its testing and quality assurance to Techno Brain in Kenya. Speaking on the partnership, Techno Brain Group CEO Manoj Shanker, said “this has been as a result of two years of work between us and the Microsoft team.” With this partnership, the Techno Brain Nairobi test center will have exclusive access to Windows Insider software builds that are yet to be released in the global market. The Techno Brain-Microsoft partnership comes as no surprise because last year, Techno Brain achieved the 2017 Microsoft Country Partner of the Year Award for their Tanzania office. The award recognized Techno Brain as succeeding in effective engagement with its local Microsoft office while showcasing innovation and business impact, improving citizen services and empowering lives. The awards presented in several categories had winners chosen from a set of more than 2800 entrants from 115 countries worldwide. Techno Brain was honoured among a global field of top Microsoft partners for demonstrating excellence in innovation and implementation of customer solutions based on Microsoft technology. The newly launched Software testing centre will have highly skilled engineers perform vigorous tests of applications and looks to provide 1000 jobs to Kenyan’s. Asides Kenya’s Nairobi, presently there are only three other Microsoft test engineering sites globally outside China, Poland and India.
