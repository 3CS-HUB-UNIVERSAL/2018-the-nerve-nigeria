The British Journal of Photography (BJP) takes an international perspective on contemporary photography, focusing on fine art and documentary, and the cutting edge of editorial and commercial practices. Annually highlighting some of the brightest emerging photographers and projects from all around the world, this year’s edition of the Ones To Watch issue profiles artists with a dedicated interview, along with comments from the curators, editors, photographers and artistic directors who put them forward. For this year’s list, they’ve put 16 names from four continents in the spotlight, selected by “a global panel of experts and tastemakers” from over 500 nominations. Included in the list is Noma Osula, who “draws on the energy of his native Lagos for his colourful narratives on Africa.” The talented young photographer is known for capturing vibrant portraits that celebrate the people and culture around him. Osula has been featured on award winning literary magazine, American Chortana.  “Since its inception in 2011, we’ve had ambitions to grow Ones To Watch and give a bigger platform to the selected photographers,” writes BJP’s editor Simon Bainbridge. “What began as an extended feature soon became a whole issue dedicated to emerging talent.” As part of BJP’s aims to broaden its talent programme, this year, for the first time, several artists from the Ones To Watch issue will also be exhibited during Peckham 24.
