Ghana’s power utility companies on Monday said the Jubilee FPSO Kwame Nkrumah will not be operating from next week for 21 days. The temporary shutdown was attributed to the need for the vessel to undergo repairs. Shutting down the vessel that produces both oil and gas next Monday will result in a cut to offshore gas supply, the companies said in a statement. Any loss of power generation would be offset by generating additional power from the eastern port of Tema area, they added. The discovery of damage to a turret bearing on the vessel in 2016 made the power utilities decide that the production vessel needed to be shut down, in order to fix it. In April, the Deputy Energy and Petroleum Minister, Muhammed Amin Adam, in a briefing, after a working visit, informed journalists that the production vessel at Tullow’s flagship Jubilee oilfield off Ghana’s west coast was expected to be shut down this month for a general routine maintenance exercise. Adam noted that the temporary shutdown of the oil and gas production vessel is to ensure a long term solution to the frequent breakdown of the turrets. “The turret challenge has been a major challenge for our country, we have gone to see the kind of work going on there and I’m impressed about the level of work done there,” he stated. Ghanaians were assured that the impact of the shutdown will be minimized since Ghana Gas is now in full operation to receive about 60 million standard cubic feet of Gas every day from the 10 fields. “From what we saw and the briefing we got from our partners, the effect of the shutdown on power generation will not be much and therefore, I will like to inform Ghanaians that there is no cause for alarm,” Adam said. He also explained that the government will not entertain too many shutdowns of the vessel since it has effects on the country in terms of revenue.
