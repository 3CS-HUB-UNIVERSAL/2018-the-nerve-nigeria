East Africa’s most prominent upmarket coffee and casual-dining chain, Java House Africa, announced plans to more than triple its outlets in Kenya over the next two years before expanding across East Africa and beyond. This announcement which was made known to Reuters in an interview with the Chief Executive Paul Smith comes a year after it was acquired by Dubai based private equity firm Abraaj. According to Smith, the company plans to open 25 new restaurants in Uganda and a dozen in Rwanda over the next five years. It is looking at entering Nigeria, either as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise or in a joint venture and searching for franchise opportunities in South Africa. Abraaj’s East Africa managing director Ashish Patel also said Java is performing beyond expectations nine months since the takeover and it is on track to grow by several multiples within five years. The sale of Java last year by Emerging Capital Partners (ECP) drew a lot of attention as ECP received more than 10 bids. This landmark deal in the African consumer market showed a strong private equity interest in East Africa’s consumer sector.
