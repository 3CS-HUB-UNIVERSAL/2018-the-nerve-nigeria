HBO has announced that it will air its feature-length documentary Stolen Daughters: Kidnapped by Boko Haram in the fall. The story of a group of Nigerian girls kidnapped from a Chibok school in 2014 by Islamic jihadist group Boko Haram are the subject of the forthcoming film. The traumatising event saw a global social media campaign centered on #BringBackOurGirls, featuring global celebrities including Michelle Obama, bring huge pressure on the Nigerian government to get the girls back. Exactly a year ago, 82 of the 276 schoolgirls were realeased. A co-production with BBC2 and ARTE France, Stolen Daughters was granted exclusive access to the freed girls who were taken to a secret government safe house in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja. Known as “The Chibok Girls”, the girls are required to live in a protected environment, where contact with the outside world is severely limited, though they are provided with education and counseling. The film tells the disturbing stories of the girls’ time in captivity and shows how the young women are adapting to life after their long imprisonment. The documentary also reveals the Nigerian government’s effort in handling their re-entry into society since their release, and their eventually progress to a residential, government-funded program at the American University of Nigeria. Boko Haram still lurks in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, and even then, the ordeal of the people in the affected communities are far from over as many live in poor conditions in slums and refugee camps. Stolen Daughters is directed by Karen Edwards and Gemma Atwal; and also produced by Edwards. For HBO, the executive producer on the project is Nancy Abraham.
