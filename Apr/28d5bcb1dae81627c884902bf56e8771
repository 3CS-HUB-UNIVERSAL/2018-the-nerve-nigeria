The 2018 Tana High-Level Forum on security in Africa took place at the Blue Nile Resort, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. The event was themed ‘Ownership of Africa’s Peace and Security Provision: Financing and Reforming the African Union’ and it spanned from 2o to 22 April. It brought together high-level decision-makers on peace and security from all over the continent. Here are takeaways from the just concluded forum: Summarily, the African Union still has a lot to do in ensuring the safety of its peoples. However, the Tana Forum suggests that with dedication to the pan-African cause, appropriate integration of the right mechanisms and a clear-caught vision, Africa would attain its right position in the world and keeping peace and security on the continent.
