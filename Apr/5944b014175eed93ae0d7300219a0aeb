In a bid to promote local productions and ensure better operations, Tanzanian President, John Magufuli has announced that importation of sugar is put to a stop. The President looks to encourage more businesses in the country and enhance local production by individual companies. He believes sugar plants in the country has what it takes to sustain the demand of the market by itself. Prior to this development, Magufuli had restricted the issuance of sugar imports permits, demanding that only valid imported sugar gets clearance from his office and that of the Prime Minister. In January, the East African country was plagued by a deepening sugar crisis that had the country’s Trade and Environment Committee issue a directive to the government to fast-track clearance of stalled industrial sugar at the Dar es Salaam Port, in order to avert the looming crisis of shutting down factories.
