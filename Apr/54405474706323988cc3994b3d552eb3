Ethiopia’s newly elected prime minister Abiy Ahmed has announced plans to amend the country’s constitution to put a term limit to the office of the Prime Minister in a bid to strengthen the country’s democratic system and fight corruption. Speaking to an audience in Hawassa city, capital of Ethiopia’s Southern regional state, Ahmed said legislation is underway to amend the Ethiopian constitution to place a two-term limit on the Prime Minister position. Currently, the Ethiopian constitution has a two-term limit on the President’s office that spans for five years. The constitution, however, allows an indefinite period for a Prime Minister to stay in office. The 41-year-old Prime Minister was sworn in before the Ethiopian parliament on April 2, replacing Hailemariam Desalegn after various anti-government protests and strikes in the East African country. According to Ahmed, ‘‘Hailemariam resigned at a time when he could contribute a lot for his country, however, there are leaders who refuse to leave office though they have to retire.” The government of Ethiopia is structured in the form of a federal parliamentary republic, whereby the Prime Minister is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the government while legislative power is vested in the Parliament. The Judiciary isa independent of the executive and the legislature. There are 9 ethnically based administrative regions and two self-governing administrations
