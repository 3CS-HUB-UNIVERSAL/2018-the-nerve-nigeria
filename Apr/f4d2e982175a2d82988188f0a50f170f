In a quest to put an end to corruption which has plagued the Nation for years, the Nigerian government on Sunday released the second list of alleged looters of the treasury during the Goodluck Jonathan administration. Since the creation of modern public administration in the country, there have been cases of official misuse of funds and resources, as political corruption is a persistent phenomenon in Nigeria. The new list that was released during a press conference has 23 names of alleged looters which the Information and Culture Minister, Lai Mohammed said was based on verifiable facts, including the amount involved, the date the amount in question was collected and from where it was taken. Here are the names that made the list and the amount allegedly embezzled The Information Minister noted that the list was strategically released as a teaser, from the government’s large list of alleged looters. “I did say it was a tip of the iceberg,” the minister said. Statistics revealed that between an 8-year period from 2006-2013, 25 people allegedly embezzled about $6.8 billion funds that could cater for a 635 kilometers dual carriage and 20,000 housing units, with enough money left to construct one model hospital in the federation, close to 180 schools that can educate almost 4,000 children from primary to tertiary level. There has been a serious battle against corruption since the coming into power of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, though opposition party in the West African State accuse the present administration of wanting to paint the past administration in a bad light. However, Mohammed Lai on behalf of the Buhari administration noted that the Nigerian government will not be intimidated or blackmailed into silence, and neither will it rest until all those who looted the public treasury have been brought to justice.
