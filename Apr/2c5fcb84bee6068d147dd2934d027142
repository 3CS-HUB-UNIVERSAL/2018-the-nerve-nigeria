Before European football leagues became widespread in Africa, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), a sport that was popular on local television in the 90s for both its story lines and action, dominated the sports and entertainment scenes. It was and is still not uncommon to see children of all ages gathered on streets around flickering screens that, upon passing, would reveal muscular bodies in spandex lifting each other while springing back from the elastic springs that bound the arena. Last week, American professional wrestling stars converged in South Africa to give African fans a real life feel of that on-screen action. Three different shows staged in Pretoria, Cape Town and Johannesburg offered an explosive tour that left fans yearning for more. Thousands of South Africans thronged the 20,000 seater Dome in Northgate suburb of Johannesburg with gate prices ranging from R460 and R1975 completely sold out. The company, very understandably, may now look to host another tour in Africa and they’re considering Nairobi, Kenya, this time. Speaking with Game Yetu, WWE Vice President International Communication Dan Humphreys said, “We are always on the lookout to go where our fans are and are not ruling out Nairobi or any other city on the continent once we see the interest is sufficient.” The shows were organised by pay television channel Multichoice and featured WWE Superstars Braun Strowman, Seth Rollins, Dean Ambrose, Intercontinental Champion Roman Reigns, RAW Women’s Champion Alexa Bliss, Sasha Banks, Asuka, RAW Tag Team Champions Cesaro and Sheamus, and more.
