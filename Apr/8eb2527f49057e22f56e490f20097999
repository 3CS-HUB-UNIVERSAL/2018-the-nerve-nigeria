World Bank plans to invest $500 million on education reforms in Egypt in a bid to expand access to early education using technical innovations in line with Egypt’s vision 2030. World Bank’s support for reforming Egypt’s education system will boost access to quality eduation for half a million children in kindergarten, training half a million teachers and education officials and providing 1.5 million students and teachers with digital learning resources. “We welcome the World Bank’s support to the implementation of our ambitious home-grown education sector reform programme,” said Sahar Nasr, Egypt’s minister for investment and international cooperation. “It’s a strategic opportunity and the government is fully committed to developing the education system to build a productive generation that is well-equipped and ready for the competitive world.” In addition, Asad Alam, World Bank country director for Egypt, stated that stronger education systems are crucial to improving productivity and growth. He said, “By focusing on strengthening learning conditions, young Egyptians will be better prepared for higher paying and skilled jobs of the future.” Most recent data from the Human Development Index (HDI), noted that Egypt is ranked 108 in the HDI, and 9 in the lowest 10 HDI countries in the Middle East and Northern Africa. The net enrolment rate in primary education declined from 95.4 percent in 2011 to 90.6 percent in 2014, while the Net rate in preparatory education increased by 12 percent during this period. Proportion of pupils starting grade 1 who reach last grade of primary declined from 97.2 percent in 2010/2011 to 95 percent in 2014, 2.2 percent. Egypt’s vision 2030 is to provide quality education and training system available to all, without discrimination, within an efficient, just, sustainable and flexible institutional framework, while providing the necessary skills to students and trainees to think creatively, technically and technologically.
