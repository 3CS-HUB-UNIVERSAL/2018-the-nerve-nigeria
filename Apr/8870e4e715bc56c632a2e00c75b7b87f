In celebration of the World Book and Copyright Day 2018 marked yesterday, the Vice President of Nigeria Prof. Yemi Osinbajo read to the children of L.E.A. Primary School, Life Camp, Abuja, in an event organised by Rainbow Book Club. Also in attendance was the Minister of Education Adamu Adamu and the Hon. Minister of FCT Mallam Muhammad Musa Bello, who gave the opening welcome, and Mr Ajaegbo representing UNESCO. The room was filled with a sense of anticipation at first, then excitement as the reading was taken from a book titled The Legend: Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe by Olajire Olanlokun. The reading session was moderated by Mrs. Koko Kalango, founder of Rainbow Book Club, who handled interactions around the book while the 50 pupils present quietly listened as the Vice President read. Excerpts read from the book focused on the early life and education of Late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe and his fight for Nigeria’s independence. At the end of the programme, the excitement still lingered as the children cheered the Vice President and took several pictures with him. There were also lots of interactions on social media as the hashtags #Nigeriareadswithrainbow and #Nigeriareads trended on various platforms. Since 2005, the Rainbow Book Club has been involved in various advocacy programmes to draw attention to the importance of reading in personal and national development by setting up and running book clubs for primary and secondary school children—as well as adults—to encourage social interaction around books. They have since developed libraries to bring good reading material to the host community and in particular to indigent communities. The Rainbow Book Club kicked off its ‘Get Nigeria Reading again’ campaign in May 2005 with Purple Hibiscus as book-of-the-month and Chimamanda Adichie as guest author. They were also organisers of the 2014 World Book Capital in Port Harcourt.
