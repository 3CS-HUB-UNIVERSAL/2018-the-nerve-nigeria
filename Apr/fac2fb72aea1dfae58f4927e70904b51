Starting on Monday, 9th April, Facebook plans to inform their 87 million global users whose data have been shared by Cambridge Analytica that their privacy has been breached. According to Facebook, most of the affected users (over 70 million) are in the United States. However, there are 16 million scattered in various other countries across the continent. From Monday, all 2.2 billion Facebook users will receive a notification on their news feeds titled ‘Protecting Your Information,’ with a link notifying them of installed applications capable of sharing their vital information. While notifying its users of their installed applications, Facebook also intends to propose to each user an option of total shut down of these applications or the ‘turn off third-party access’ to their Facebook application. Two days ago, Facebook revealed that the data of South Africans was obtained by Cambridge Analytica through an application called “thisisyourdigitallife” that was developed by Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan as a personality test. A total of 59,777 users who downloaded the application in South Africa are at a potential risk. Last month, Facebook announced it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and its British parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, from its platform after the data company secretly obtained data from over 70 million users of the social media platform.
